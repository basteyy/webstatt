# Welcome to Webstatt

Webstatt is some kind of Content Management System written in PHP. With Webstatt I tried to create a simple-to-use system, which is flexibel enough to get used in all kind of 
projects. 
The focus was on to create a application, which makes it easy to build websites for any kind of customers. That's why a few things, like user management, content management, file browser are shipped with Webstatt.

If you ask me if you should use Webstatt in your next project? I don't know. But before using it in bigger projects, you should try it in a small szenario. In case you find 
Webstatt usefully, I would like to hear from you. And when you have an idea to make Webstatt a better system, please contribute your thoughts. 

***Bugs*** are in Webstatt for sure. If you found them, please report them via [GitHub](https://github.com/basteyy/webstatt/issues)
